Development: Katia: “As we approach the castle, notice the architectural styles. Reflecting its history, the castle has seen numerous expansions and reconstructions. From Gothic to Romanesque, every era left its mark here."

    Alex: "Wow, it's like a walk through a historical art book. I never realized the extent of changes this castle endured!"

    Katia: “Now, let’s step into the time portal, back to the 15th century, during the Hussite Wars..."

Climax: Suddenly, they find themselves amidst a Hussite siege of Prague Castle, with booming cannons and clashing swords all around.

    Alex: "This is chaotic! The castle is under attack!"

    Katia: “Indeed, Alex. But remember, we are here to observe, learn, and ensure history remains the same. We need to protect a vital artifact: The Bohemian Crown Jewels.”

    Together, they navigate through the chaos, avoiding Hussite soldiers and making their way into the castle. They locate the Bohemian Crown Jewels just as a group of intruders breaks into the room. With quick thinking and teamwork, they manage to outwit the intruders, ensuring the crown jewels remain untouched.
