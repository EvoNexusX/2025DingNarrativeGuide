Intro: **

Katia: (Excited) Alex, welcome to the heart of Prague. Before us stands the magnificent Prague Astronomical Clock, a testament to the ingenuity of our ancestors. 

Alex: (Awestruck) It's even more impressive than I imagined! The attention to detail is astounding. 

Katia: Indeed, Alex. Installed in 1410, it's the third oldest astronomical clock in the world, and the oldest one still in operation. 

**
Development: **

Katia: (Serious) There's a legend Alex, that if the clock is neglected, the city will suffer. A mounted ghost is supposed to nod its head in confirmation.

Alex: (Curious) What happens then, Katia?

Katia: (Mysteriously) Only a boy born on New Year's night can save the city. 

(As they talk, the clock comes alive, the apostle figures move, the skeleton strikes the time, it's as if they've stepped back in time)

Alex: (Amazed) Wow, it's like we've traveled back in time!

Katia: (Smiles) Exactly, Alex. Here, history is a living entity!

**
Climax: **

(A sudden gust of wind sweeps through the square. The clock's hands start moving backward rapidly. The crowd gasps)

Katia: (Worried) Something's not right, Alex. 

Alex: (Nervous) The clock, it's moving backward!

(They look at each other and rush towards the clock tower. The city around them starts changing, buildings morph into older versions, people's clothing changes. They have traveled back in time)

Katia: (Worried) We need to stop this; history is being changed!

Alex: (Determined) Let's do this, Katia. 

(They climb the tower, fighting against the flow of time. Reaching the mechanism, they struggle to fix the gears. Alex spots a loose gear and pushes it back into place)

**
Ending: **

(The clock hands stop moving, then slowly start ticking forward again. The city returns to its present state)

Katia: (Relieved) We did it, Alex!

Alex: (Exhales) That was close, Katia! 

Katia: (Proud) Today, you didn't just learn history, Alex. You lived it!

Alex: (Grateful) Thanks to you, Katia. I'll always remember the Prague Astronomical Clock and the day we saved history together.

Katia: (Smiles) That's what makes this journey special, Alex. The echoes of the past always resonate with the present, shaping our future.

(The clock chimes, a testament to time's continuity and the enduring charm of Prague and its history)
