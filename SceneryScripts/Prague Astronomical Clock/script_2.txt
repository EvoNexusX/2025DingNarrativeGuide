Intro: (Alex and Katia stand before the Prague Astronomical Clock)
Katia: "Alex, are you ready to step back in time?"
Alex: "Absolutely! Couldn't be more excited."
Development: (Katia begins explaining the history and legends of the clock)
Katia: "This clock, called the Orloj, was installed here on the Old Town Hall tower in 1410. It’s not just one of the oldest astronomical clocks in the world, but the oldest still working."
Alex: "Wow, that's fascinating! You mentioned legends?"

Katia: "Indeed, there’s an eerie one. They say the city will suffer if the clock is neglected. A ghost, supposedly mounted on the clock, nods its head in affirmation. The only hope lies with a boy born on New Year's night."
Alex: "That's a chilling tale! But it adds a layer of mystique, doesn't it?"
Climax: (Just as Alex finishes his sentence, the clock starts to malfunction)
Alex: "Wait, is that supposed to happen?"
Katia: "No, it isn't. Let's find the caretaker."

(They find the caretaker, an old man, lying on the ground, unconscious. Alex rushes to his aid while Katia looks around for help.)
Katia: "Alex, there's no one else. We need to fix the clock to calm the city's spirit."

(Using the knowledge from his years of studying history and Katia's understanding of the clock's mechanism, they manage to manually set the clock back in motion just as the hour strikes.)
Ending: (The caretaker regains consciousness and thanks them.)
Caretaker: "You two saved the city. I can't thank you enough!"
Katia: "We did what we had to. Right, Alex?"
Alex: "Exactly. And we got more adventure than we signed up for!"

(They leave the tower, the city now calm, the Orloj ticking away, as it has done for centuries.)
Alex: "Katia, I've got to admit, today has been like stepping into a storybook. I cannot wait for our next adventure."
Katia: "Indeed, Alex. There are many more legends awaiting us in the heart of Europe." 

(As they walk away, we hear the Orloj striking the hour, its age-old melody echoing through the streets of Prague.)
