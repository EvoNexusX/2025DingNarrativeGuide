Intro: **
(Alex Thompson and Katia Müller meet under the Astronomical Clock in Old Town Square, Prague.)

Katia: (Smiling warmly) "Alex, welcome back! Ready to travel back in time once again?"

Alex: (Nods excitedly) "Absolutely, Katia! Where are we heading today?"

Katia: (Points to the Old Town Square) "We're already here, Alex. This is the Old Town Square, a marketplace in the 10th century and the heartbeat of Prague."

**
Development: **

Katia: (Begins walking around the square, pointing out different architectural styles) "From Gothic to Baroque to Rococo, each building here tells a story, Alex. And the most chilling one is of the 27 Czech nobles."

Alex: (Follows Katia, taking in the rich visual history) "The ones executed in 1621? I've taught that lesson so many times, but standing here where it actually happened... It's surreal."

Katia: "Yes, and their story is not forgotten. Look beneath your feet." 

Alex: (Looks down to see 27 crosses) "Oh, a dark reminder of a tragic past."

**
Climax: **

(Suddenly, the vibrant square turns grey and lifeless. People around turn into phantoms, reenacting the execution scene.)

Katia: (Grabs Alex’s hand) "Alex, we're not just observers anymore. We need to ensure the past remains as it is. We need to stop the phantoms from altering the story."

Alex: (Nervously) "How do we do that?"

Katia: "We need to reaffirm the historical truth. You're a history teacher, Alex. You know the story. Tell it!"

(Alex steps forward, reciting the events leading up to and following the execution with conviction. As he speaks, the phantoms start to dissolve.)

**
Ending: **

(With the truth reaffirmed, the phantom execution scene fades, and the vibrant life of the Old Town Square returns.)

Katia: (Smiling) "Well done, Alex! You protected their legacy. History remains intact."

Alex: (Breathing heavily) "That was intense... but remarkably enlightening. I've never felt so connected to history before."

Katia: "And that, Alex, is the magic of Prague. Each corner of this city has stories to tell. We just have to listen."

(They leave the Old Town Square, the echoes of the past still resonating as they prepare for their next adventure.)
