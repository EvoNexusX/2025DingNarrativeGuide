# Narrative-Driven Travel Planning: Geocultural-Grounded Script Generation with Evolutionary Itinerary Optimization

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation  of the paper "Narrative-Driven Travel Planning: Geocultural-Grounded Script Generation with Evolutionary Itinerary Optimization".

### Key Contributions

- Proposed a narrative-driven travel planning framework called **NarrativeGuide** that generates a geoculturally-grounded narrative script for travelers.
- Developed a knowledge graph for city attractions and used it to configure the worldview, character setting, and exposition.
- Modeled narrative-driven travel planning as an optimization problem and utilized a genetic algorithm (GA) to refine the itinerary.

### Experimental Results

- Significant improvements in narrative coherence and cultural fit.
- Notable reduction in travel time and increase in the quality of visited attractions.
