As Katia and Alex reflect on the echoes of the past in Old Town Square, they ready themselves for the next journey. The sun had started to set, casting long shadows on the cobblestones. 

Katia: (Gesturing towards the setting sun) "You see that, Alex? When the sun sets on the Old Town Square, it's as though the city is tucking away its memories for the night. But not all memories sleep with the sunset."

Alex: (Curious) "What do you mean, Katia?"

Katia: (Smiling) "Well, Alex. Some memories, some stories, are kept alive through the night. They are told and retold, not through words or books, but through the intricate dance of time and light."

Alex: (Excited) "Are we heading somewhere to witness this dance?"

Katia: (Nods) "Absolutely, Alex. We're heading towards the Prague Astronomical Clock. A timekeeper that not only tracks the hours and minutes but also the celestial bodies. This masterpiece has witnessed and kept alive Prague's history for over six centuries."

With the promise of another historical adventure, Katia and Alex leave the Old Town Square, their minds filled with the echoes of the past and their hearts excited for the dance of time that awaits them at the Prague Astronomical Clock. 

This transition script smoothly connects both the scenic spots by referencing the passage of time and the importance of memories and history, which are integral to both locations. It also provides a plausible reason for moving from the Old Town Square to the Prague Astronomical Clock - to witness the 'dance of time and light' that the clock represents.
