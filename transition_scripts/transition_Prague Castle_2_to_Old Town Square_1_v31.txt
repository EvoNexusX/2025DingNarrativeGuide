(After their adventure at Prague Castle, Katia and Alex walk through the cobbled streets, taking in the rich history around them.)

Katia: (Looking at Alex) "You did well at the castle, Alex. But remember, history is not just about grand castles and nobility. It's also about the common people, the heart of the city."

Alex: (Nods thoughtfully) "That's true. So where do we experience that?"

Katia: (Smiling) "Follow me, Alex. There's another place not far from here, where the pulse of Prague's history is felt just as deeply."

(They walk in silence, the city's history echoing around them. As they turn a corner, the bustling Old Town Square comes into view.)

Katia: (Gesturing towards the square) "Welcome to the Old Town Square, Alex. Once a marketplace in the 10th century, it's been at the heart of Prague's life for over a thousand years."

Alex: (Looking around excitedly) "I can't wait to dive into its history, Katia. Let's get started!" 

(With that, they step into the square, ready to embark on their next historical adventure.)
