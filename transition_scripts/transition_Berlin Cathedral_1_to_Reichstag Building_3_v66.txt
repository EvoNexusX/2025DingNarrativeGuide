As they step away from the Berlin Cathedral, Katia turns to Alex, a twinkle in her eye. "I hope you've found this experience enlightening. The cathedral has indeed seen many pivotal moments. But let's shift our focus from the spiritual to the political. From divine interventions, we move to the power of democracy."

Alex looks at her curiously, "What's our next destination?" 

Katia smiles, "We are heading to the Reichstag, the seat of the German parliament. It's a place that has witnessed the rise and fall of empires, the horrors of war, and the joy of reunification. It's a testament to the resilience of this city and the spirit of its people."

As they walk towards their next destination, the imposing silhouette of the Reichstag starts to appear in the distance, its glass dome gleaming against the Berlin sky. Alex takes in the sight, the thrill of their next adventure already starting to build.

"Ready for another plunge into the past, Alex?" Katia asks, her voice full of anticipation.

With a determined nod, Alex replies, "Absolutely. Let's unravel the layers of history this place holds."

As they approach the iconic building, they leave behind the spiritual aura of the cathedral, ready to dive into the tumultuous political history that the Reichstag embodies. Their journey of time continues, promising more thrills, more insights, and a deeper connection with the city's past.
