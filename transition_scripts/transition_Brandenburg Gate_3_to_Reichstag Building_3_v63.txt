*(Having returned to their own time at the Brandenburg Gate, Alex and Katia take a moment to reflect on their journey through history. The bustling city of Berlin resumes its pace around them, oblivious to the echoes of time they've just experienced)*

ALEX: (Looking around) So much history in one place... I can hardly believe it.

KATIA: (Smiling) The past is always closer than we think, Alex. And there's more to see. Ready for the next chapter?

ALEX: (Nods) Definitely. Where are we headed?

KATIA: (Points to the distance) See that building over there? That's the Reichstag. It's not just a building, it's another portal through time, just like the Brandenburg Gate. A different chapter of Berlin's story, but equally rich and poignant. 

*(They start walking towards the Reichstag, the grand edifice growing larger as they approach. The glass dome of the building glimmers in the sunlight, a symbol of transparency, resilience, and the democratic spirit)* 

ALEX: (Looking at the Reichstag) From the Brandenburg Gate to the Reichstag... from one historic symbol to another. This is one journey I'm not likely to forget.

*(As they reach the foot of the Reichstag, the echoes of history begin to resonate once again, hinting at the time-traveling journey that awaits them)*

KATIA: (Gesturing to the Reichstag) Let's step into another chapter of history, Alex. Prepare to witness the might of an empire, the rise and fall of the Nazis, and the rebirth of a nation. 

*(With a sense of anticipation and a renewed thirst for knowledge, they approach the Reichstag, ready to embark on their next time-traveling adventure)*
