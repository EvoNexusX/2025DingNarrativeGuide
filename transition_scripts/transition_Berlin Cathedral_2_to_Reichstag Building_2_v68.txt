(After taking one last look at the Berlin Cathedral, Katia and Alex step through a time portal. They emerge in front of another imposing building.)

Katia: "Alex, our journey through time is far from over. Every historic spot in Berlin has a story to tell, and some of these stories are interwoven, echoing the same lessons. The next chapter of our adventure takes us to the Reichstag Building."

Alex: "The Reichstag? The German Parliament building? I remember studying about it."

Katia: "Indeed, Alex. The Reichstag, like the Berlin Cathedral, was a silent witness to the tumultuous events of World War II. It too carries the scars of the past, alongside its present-day glory."

Alex: "From a cathedral to a parliament building. That's quite a transition, Katia."

Katia: "It may seem so, Alex, but both these places carry the same message - resilience in the face of adversity and the power of preservation. The Reichstag was once consumed by fire and nearly destroyed in the war, much like the cathedral. Yet today, it stands as a beacon of unity and democracy."

Alex: "I see, it's not about the type of building, but the history that it carries. The echoes of the past that resonate within its walls."

Katia: "Exactly, Alex. Let's continue our journey through time, learn more about the past, and understand how it shapes the present and the future." 

(They walk towards the Reichstag Building, ready to delve into the next chapter of their time-traveling adventure.)
