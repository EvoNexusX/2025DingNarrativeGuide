As Alex and Katia share a final glance at the Charles Bridge, the sun painting the horizon with hues of gold, they can't help but feel a sense of accomplishment. 

Katia: "What a remarkable day, Alex. But, it's not over yet. We have one more place to visit."

Alex: "Oh? Where to next?"

Katia: (pointing towards the Prague Castle) "There, towering over the city, is our next destination - the St. Vitus Cathedral."

As they walk towards the cathedral, they can see the sun setting behind Prague Castle, casting a magnificent silhouette. Their conversation is filled with anticipation and curiosity, their hearts beating with the thrill of their next historical adventure. 

Alex: "Why St. Vitus Cathedral, Katia?"

Katia: "The St. Vitus Cathedral is not just a building, Alex. It is a testament to the resilience and hope of the Czech people. Just like the Charles Bridge, it has stood the test of time, shaping and being shaped by history. It is more than just a cathedral; it's a living, breathing piece of our past."

Alex: "I look forward to experiencing it."
