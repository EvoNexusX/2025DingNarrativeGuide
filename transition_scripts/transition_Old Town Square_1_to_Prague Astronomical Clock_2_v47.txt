(Alex and Katia leave the haunting echoes of the Old Town Square, their hearts still pounding from the intense historical encounter.)

Katia: (Smiling at Alex) "Well, you did splendidly back there, Alex. It's not every day that a history teacher gets to interact with history so directly!"

Alex: (Laughs, shaking his head) "You're right. But that's the beauty of Prague, isn't it? How every cobblestone, every building, holds a tale."

Katia: (Nods, thoughtfully) "Indeed, Alex. And speaking of buildings with tales, there's a particular one I think you'll be interested in."

Alex: (Raises an eyebrow curiously) "Really? Which one?"

Katia: (Points towards the Old Town Hall tower) "See that tower? It houses the Prague Astronomical Clock, or the Orloj. It's one of the oldest astronomical clocks in the world, still working."

Alex: (Eyes widen in excitement) "The Orloj? I've read so much about it! But why the sudden shift from the Square to the Clock?"

Katia: "Well, just like the Square, the Clock too has a chilling story tied to it. Plus, it's a perfect example of how Prague's past and present coexist. While you saw the past come alive at the Square, here at the Clock, you'll see how the past influences and intertwines with the present."

Alex: (Nods in understanding) "That sounds incredible. Let's get to it then!"

(They walk towards the Prague Astronomical Clock, leaving the echoes of the Old Town Square behind, ready to unveil another layer of Prague's mesmerizing history.)
