(As they walk away from the Charles Bridge, the Prague Castle in the distance catches Alex's eye.)

Katia: "I see you've noticed the Prague Castle. It's home to one of the most iconic structures in the city, St. Vitus Cathedral, designed by the same architect who designed this bridge."

Alex: "Really? The same architect? That's fascinating."

Katia: "Yes, Peter Parler. His designs have left an enduring mark on Prague. How about we dive deeper into his work? St. Vitus Cathedral is not only a remarkable example of Gothic architecture but also a treasury of Czech history, just like Charles Bridge."

Alex: "I would love to see more of his work and learn more about Czech history. Let's go."

(As they approach the cathedral, the grandeur of the structure leaves Alex in awe.)

Katia: "Welcome to St. Vitus Cathedral, Alex."

Transition Reason: The transition from Charles Bridge to St. Vitus Cathedral is justified by the shared history and the common architect, Peter Parler, linking the two sites, creating a thematic continuity. It offers an opportunity to further explore Prague's history and architectural legacy, building on the interest sparked at Charles Bridge.
