(As Alex and Katia leave the Charles Bridge, they continue their walk along the cobblestone streets of Prague.)

Katia: (Points towards a grand silhouette in the distance) Alex, you see that majestic structure ahead? That's our next destination - the Prague Castle.

Alex: (Eyes widen) Wow, that's enormous! It looks like a city within a city.

Katia: (Laughs) Yes, it's often described that way. The Castle represents the heart of Prague and is one of the largest ancient castles in the world. Let's move on from the bridge's stories of endurance and resilience, to the castle's tales of power and royalty.

Alex: (Nods) I’m intrigued, Katia. After experiencing the layers of history at the Charles Bridge, I’m excited to uncover the stories that the Castle holds.

Katia: (Smiling) That's the spirit, Alex! We have to keep exploring, keep learning. The more we know about the past, the better we can protect it, just as we agreed at the bridge. 

Alex: (Enthusiastically) Yes, let's do this! Onwards to the Prague Castle!

(And so, they set off towards the Prague Castle, ready to plunge into another chapter of Prague's rich history.)
