(After leaving Prague Castle, Alex and Katia begin to descend towards the lower levels of the castle complex.)

Katia: (Smiling) "Alex, before we leave the castle complex, there's another place I would like to show you. It's a little different from what we have seen so far but equally enchanting."

Alex: (Curious) "What's that?"

Katia: (With a hint of mystery) "It's called the Golden Lane. It's a charming little street within the Prague Castle complex, filled with colorful houses. Each house has its own story to tell. Are you ready to explore it?"

Alex: (Eager) "Absolutely! Let's go!"

(As they walk towards the Golden Lane, Katia explains that after witnessing the grandeur of Prague Castle and understanding its historical significance, it's now time to experience the simpler, everyday life of the past residents of the castle complex. The Golden Lane offers a unique perspective of the past, showcasing the lives of the common people, artists, and alchemists who once called this place home.) 

Katia: (Explaining) "After experiencing the grand history of Prague Castle, the Golden Lane will give us a glimpse into the everyday lives of the people who lived and worked within these castle walls. From castle guards to goldsmiths and even famed writers like Franz Kafka, this little lane holds their stories."

(With this, they arrive at the entrance of the Golden Lane, ready to uncover its secrets.)
