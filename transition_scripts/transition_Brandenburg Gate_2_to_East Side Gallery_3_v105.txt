(Alex and Katia exit the Brandenburg Gate, their hearts still racing from their journey through time. The sounds of modern Berlin welcome them back.)

Alex: "That was quite an experience, Katia!"

Katia (smiling): "Yes, it was. But our journey isn't over yet."

Alex: "What's next?"

Katia: "We're going to visit another testament of Berlin's history, a place that symbolizes the city's pain and progress."

(She gestures towards a nearby wall adorned with vibrant murals.)

Alex (curious): "The East Side Gallery?"

Katia: "Correct, Alex. The longest remaining stretch of the Berlin Wall. It's a place where art meets history, where the city's painful past is turned into a hopeful future."

Alex (nodding): "From one historical site to another. I'm ready."

(They make their way towards the East Side Gallery, leaving the grandeur of the Brandenburg Gate behind. As they walk, the towering gate slowly melds into the urban landscape, replaced by the colourful expanse of the East Side Gallery. The transition echoes the city's own journey from a divided past towards unity and progress.)
