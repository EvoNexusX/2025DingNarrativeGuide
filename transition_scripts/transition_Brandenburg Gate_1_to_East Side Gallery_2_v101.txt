(As they walk away from the Brandenburg Gate, the East Side Gallery comes into view in the distance. The colorful murals, painted on the remnants of the Berlin Wall, stand like a beacon, drawing them closer)

Katia: (gesturing towards the East Side Gallery) Our journey isn't over yet, Alex. From one symbol of unity to another, we're headed to the East Side Gallery next.

Alex: (looking curious) The Berlin Wall? But that stood for division, didn't it?

Katia: (nods) Yes, the Wall represented division, but what remains of it today is far from that. It's a symbol of freedom, unity, and the powerful voice of art. Plus, your German history expertise will be needed there too.

Alex: (smiling) Then let's go. I'm eager to see how a wall that once divided is now a symbol of unity.

(With the Brandenburg Gate behind them, echoing with the whispers of the past, they set off towards the East Side Gallery, ready to immerse themselves in another chapter of Berlin's captivating history.)
