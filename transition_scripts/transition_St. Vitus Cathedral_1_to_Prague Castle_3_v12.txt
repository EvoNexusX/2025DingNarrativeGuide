(Alex and Katia, having just completed their time-travelling journey at St. Vitus Cathedral, prepare for their next destination.)

Katia: (Looking at Alex) Our journey doesn't end here, Alex. We have seen how St. Vitus Cathedral, despite its trials, stands as a symbol of resilience. Now, it's time to explore another cornerstone of Prague's history. 

Alex: (Looking intrigued) And where would that be?

Katia: (Smiling) We're heading to the Prague Castle, another monument that has stood the test of time and witnessed transformations in both architecture and society. It's one of the grandest castles in the world, with a history as rich and layered as its architecture.

Alex: (Excited) I'm ready! After our adventure at the cathedral, I can't wait to see what we'll discover at the castle.

(They leave the cathedral, taking one last look at the magnificent structure before heading towards Prague Castle. The sun begins to set, casting a soft glow on the city, as they continue their journey through the echoes of the past.)
