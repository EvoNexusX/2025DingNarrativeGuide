*(As they step back into their own time, they take one last look at the Brandenburg Gate, enriched by the echoes of the past and the promise of the future)*

KATIA: (Smiling) I'm glad you enjoyed the journey, Alex. But our adventure doesn't stop here. There's another important monument we need to visit.

ALEX: (Intrigued) And what would that be?

KATIA: The Reichstag Building. It's not just a structure, but a testament to Germany's resilience and unity. It has stood as a silent witness to some of the most tumultuous events in our history.

ALEX: (Nods) The Reichstag, huh? I'm eager to see it. Just like the Brandenburg Gate, I've only ever read about it.

KATIA: Perfect. Let's go then. Just as we ventured through time at the Brandenburg Gate, we will do the same at the Reichstag. It's important to remember and learn from our past to truly appreciate our present and shape a better future.

*(They walk away from the Brandenburg Gate, their hearts filled with the echoes of the past, eager to embark on a new historical journey at the Reichstag Building)*

Alex: "It's amazing to think of all the history this building has witnessed."
