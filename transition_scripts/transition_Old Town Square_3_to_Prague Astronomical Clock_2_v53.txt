(Leaving behind the poignant memories of Old Town Square, Katia guides Alex towards the next landmark, the Prague Astronomical Clock, which is just a short walk away.)

Alex: (looking around) I can't believe how much history is packed into this city. Every corner, every stone has a story to tell.

Katia: True, Alex. But remember, Prague is not just about history. It is also about legends and folklore. Speaking of which, our next stop has a fascinating tale attached to it.

(Alex looks at Katia curiously)

Katia: Have you ever heard of the Orloj?

Alex: (shaking his head) I can't say I have.

Katia: Well, you're in for a treat. (Points towards the towering clock) That, Alex, is the Orloj, the oldest working astronomical clock in the world. And it has some chilling tales of its own.

(They approach the clock, its intricate designs capturing Alex's attention. The previous experience at Old Town Square has left him eager for more, ready to delve deeper into the mysteries of this ancient city. The transition from a historic execution site to a clock tower might seem odd, but in a city as timeless as Prague, the past, present, and future are inextricably intertwined, awaiting exploration.)

Alex: (Looks at Katia, grinning) Well, Katia, I'm all set to step back in time...again. Bring on the legends!

Katia: (Smiles) That's the spirit, Alex. Let the journey continue.
