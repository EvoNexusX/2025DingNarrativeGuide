(They begin to walk away from the Prague Castle, the setting sun casting long shadows over its ancient walls.)

Katia: (Gazing back at the castle) "The Prague Castle has been the heart of Czech history for centuries, Alex. But the city has many more stories to tell."

Alex: (Nods, looking at the castle) "I can see that, Katia. Each stone here seems to have a story etched into it."

Katia: (Smiling) "Yes, and not all of those stories are of kings and queens. Some are of ordinary people who lived extraordinary lives. People like Franz Kafka."

Alex: (Surprised) "Kafka? The writer?"

Katia: "Yes. He might not have been a king, but his words have resonated through generations, much like the echoes we heard in the castle. And interestingly, he too has a connection to this city."

Alex: (Curious) "Really? I'd love to learn more about that."

Katia: (Nods) "Then let's move from the grandeur of the castle to the charm of the Golden Lane. It's a step back in time, but to a very different era. It's more intimate, more personal. It's where we can walk in the footsteps of one of the greatest writers of the 20th century."

Alex: (Eager) "That sounds amazing. Let's go!"

(With that, they leave the castle behind and make their way towards the Golden Lane, ready to explore the life and legacy of Franz Kafka.)
