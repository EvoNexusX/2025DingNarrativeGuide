(As the echoes of the past fade into silence at Prague Castle, Alex and Katia find themselves standing in quiet contemplation. The castle's grandeur, now imbued with personal experiences, feels more significant.)

Alex: (Looking at Katia, eager) "Where to next? I feel like I've just run a marathon in history!"

Katia: (Laughs) "Well, we've seen the royalty's perspective. How about we get a slice of everyday life? Prague's Old Town Square is just a short walk from here."

Alex: "That sounds perfect. Let's catch our breaths amidst the liveliness of the square."

(They walk away from the majestic Prague Castle, its spires receding in the background. As they move towards the heart of the city, the atmosphere gradually changes. The royal solemnity gives way to a vibrant buzz of city life.)

(They reach Old Town Square - the heart of Prague. The cobblestone streets, the bustling crowd, the lively atmosphere, it all feels like a stark contrast to the solemn grandeur of the Prague Castle.)

Katia: (Gesturing around the square) "Welcome Alex, to the heart of Prague! Centuries of history are etched into every cobblestone of this square."

Alex: "It's beautiful, Katia. But if I may, I'd rather feel than just look. How do we activate the time portal?"

(Thus, their journey continues from the grandeur of royal life in Prague Castle to the vibrant heart of the city - Old Town Square)
