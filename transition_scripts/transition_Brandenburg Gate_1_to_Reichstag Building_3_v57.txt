(With the Brandenburg Gate receding in the backdrop, Katia and Alex begin their walk towards their next destination.)

Katia: (smiling at Alex) You did well back there, Alex. Preserving history is no small feat.

Alex: (grinning) Well, I had a great guide. Where are we heading to next?

Katia: (gesturing towards a magnificent building in the distance) See that imposing structure? That's the Reichstag, another iconic symbol of Berlin. It's a testament to Germany's tumultuous history and her relentless spirit of resurrection.

Alex: (squinting his eyes to get a better view) Ah, the seat of Germany's parliament, right? It must have a lot of stories to tell.

Katia: (nodding) Absolutely. From the grandeur of the German Empire to the horror of the Nazis, from the division of the Cold War to the joy of reunification, the Reichstag has witnessed it all. And it's not just about sharing history, Alex. The Brandenburg Gate taught us how the past can be manipulated, how crucial it is to maintain its authenticity. The Reichstag will show us the consequences of such manipulation; it's the living proof of how history's twists and turns shape a nation's present.

Alex: (excitedly) I can't wait to delve deeper into history, Katia. Let's get to it!

(With anticipation brimming in their eyes, they make their way towards the mighty Reichstag building, ready to witness the echoes of the past from another epoch of Germany's history.)
