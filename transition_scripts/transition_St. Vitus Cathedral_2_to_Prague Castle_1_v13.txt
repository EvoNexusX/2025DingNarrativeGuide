Katia: "We've done well, Alex. The echoes of history of St. Vitus Cathedral remain strong, thanks to our efforts. But our journey doesn't end here."

Alex: "Where to next, Katia?"

Katia: "We are moving towards another behemoth of history, the Prague Castle. It's not far from here. Just a short walk up the hill."

Alex: "From a cathedral to a castle â€“ this truly is a historic tour."

Katia: "Indeed, Alex. And Prague Castle isn't just any castle. It's where the fate of nations was decided, where kings and queens ruled and left their legacy. The continuity of history that we preserved in St. Vitus Cathedral? It's equally vital there."

Alex: "I'm excited, Katia. Let's head over there and see what we can do to keep the echoes of the past alive."

(They exit the cathedral, setting out for the majestic Prague Castle, ready to delve deeper into the rich tapestry of Czech history.)
