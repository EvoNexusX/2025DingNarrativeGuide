Katia: (Smiling) "I'm glad to hear that, Alex. Your enthusiasm for history and thirst for knowledge are truly inspiring. Now, we must continue our journey through time. Our next destination is a place where time itself is etched in metal and stone."

Alex: (Curious) "And where's that, Katia?"

Katia: (With a gleam in her eyes) "It's none other than the Prague Astronomical Clock. Over 600 years old and still ticking, it stands as a testament to the city's love for astronomy, art, and, of course, time."

Alex: (Excited) "I've read about it! The oldest operating astronomical clock in the world, right?"

Katia: (Nods) "Indeed. But like the Old Town Square, the clock has its own echoes to share. It doesn't just tell time but marks the passing of celestial bodies, the sun, and the moon, and even tracks the zodiac."

As Alex and Katia leave the Old Town Square, the echoes of the past fade into the hum of the present. They walk through the cobblestone streets, the city's history unfolding before them. The Prague Astronomical Clock in the distance beckons them, ready to share its own tale of time and legend. The transition from one historic location to the next is seamless, a journey from the echoes of the past to the ticking of the present.
