(As Alex and Katia leave the Old Town Square, the echoes of history and the thrill of their recent adventure still fill the air. The city of Prague, vibrant and alive, whispers tales in every corner.)

Katia: (Glancing at her watch) "Alex, do you know where we should be right now?"

Alex: (Looks at Katia, puzzled) "No, where?"

Katia: (Smiles pointing towards the towering structure in the distance) "The Prague Astronomical Clock. It's almost time for the hourly display."

Alex: (Eyes wide in anticipation) "The Walk of the Apostles! I've only seen it in videos. I can't believe I'm about to see it in person."

Katia: "There's no better way to continue our journey through time and history, Alex. The clock doesn't just mark time; it's a testament to human ingenuity and the celestial mysteries that have fascinated us for centuries."

(With excitement kindling in their hearts, they set off towards the Prague Astronomical Clock. The city's past, present, and future intermingle in the winding streets, leading them to their next adventure.)
