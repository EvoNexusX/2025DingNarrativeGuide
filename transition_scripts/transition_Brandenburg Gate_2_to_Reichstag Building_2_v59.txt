(After saving a piece of history at the Brandenburg Gate and returning to the present, Alex and Katia take a moment to reflect on their journey.)

Katia: "The Brandenburg Gate represents a critical part of Germany's history, but it's not the only monument in Berlin with stories to tell."

Alex: "I can't wait to see what's next."

Katia: "Our next stop is the Reichstag Building. It's not just a testament to Germany's history, but a symbol of resilience and unity. Just as we were able to preserve and experience the history of the Brandenburg Gate, we can do the same at the Reichstag."

(Alex takes one last look at the Brandenburg Gate before they begin their walk towards the Reichstag Building.)

Alex: "From one historical site to another. I can't wait to dive into the history of the Reichstag."

Katia: "And remember, Alex, history isn't just about facts and dates. It's about the people, the events, and the experiences that have shaped our world. Let's head over to the Reichstag and uncover its story."

(As they leave the Brandenburg Gate behind, the majestic Reichstag Building comes into view, marking the start of their next historical journey.)
