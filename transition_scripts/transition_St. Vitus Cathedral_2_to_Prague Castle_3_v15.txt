Scene: Leaving St. Vitus Cathedral, On the way to Prague Castle

(As they step out of the cathedral, the grand silhouette of Prague Castle catches Alex's eye. Katia follows his gaze, her eyes lighting up with anticipation.)

Katia: "Ah, you've spotted our next stop, Alex. That's Prague Castle, the heart of this city. Its history is just as rich, if not more."

Alex: "After what we've just experienced, I can't wait to dive into more history."

(They start walking towards the castle, the crisp air drawing a contrast to the cathedral's solemn interior.)

Katia: "Think of it this way, Alex. We've just experienced the spiritual core of Prague. Now, we're heading to its political and cultural heart. Where the cathedral was a testament to faith and resilience, the castle represents power, architectural evolution, and the city's strategic importance."

Alex: "I see... Each place tells a different part of the story, huh?"

Katia: "Exactly, Alex. And that's why we're moving from the cathedral to the castle. A city is like a book, and each location is a chapter. To understand the whole story, we must read all the chapters."

(As they approach the castle, Alex seems ready for the next chapter of their historical journey, the experience at the cathedral fresh in his mind, spurring his curiosity.)
