Alex, still awash with the thrill of their adventure, nods in agreement, his curiosity piqued. "I'm ready, Katia. Let's follow the echoes."

Moving through the city, they arrive at a massive, imposing structure. "Our next destination, Alex, is another testament to our city's resilience," Katia says, her eyes reflecting the grandeur of the building before them. It's the Reichstag Building.

"From the Berlin Cathedral, a beacon of faith, we move to the Reichstag, a beacon of unity and resilience," Katia explains. "While the Cathedral has been a witness to royal ceremonies and the ebb and flow of Berlin's history, the Reichstag stands as a symbol of Germany's political history and democratic evolution."

As they stand before the Reichstag Building, a new chapter of their historical journey ready to unfold, Alex can't help but feel a shiver of anticipation. "From faith to governance, our journey through time continues," he says, looking at the Reichstag with a newfound sense of respect and understanding.

With that, they step into the echoes of history once again, ready to explore another crucial part of Berlin's past. Their steps resonate with the echoes of the past and the promise of new stories to tell.
