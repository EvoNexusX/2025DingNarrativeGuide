(Alex and Katia exit the Brandenburg Gate, their mission accomplished. The past is secure, and with it, the lessons it carries.)

Alex: "That was an incredible experience, Katia! I can't believe we were able to step back in time and save a piece of history."

Katia: "Yes, Alex. But our journey isn't over. There are more stories to be discovered. More pieces of history that need to be preserved."

(Alex looks at her, curiosity piqued.)

Alex: "Where to next?"

(Katia points down the road, to a grand building in the distance.)

Katia: "The Reichstag Building awaits us. Much like the Brandenburg Gate, it too has a rich history that's deeply interwoven with Germany's past."

Alex: "Let's do it, Katia. I'm ready for the next chapter of our adventure."

(They start to walk towards the Reichstag Building, leaving the Brandenburg Gate behind. The echoes of the past still ring in their ears, a reminder of the history they've experienced and the history that awaits them.) 

Katia: "Just remember, Alex, our job is to preserve the truth of history. The Reichstag holds its own turbulent tales, including the infamous Reichstag fire. We'll need to be ready to safeguard it."

Alex: "With what I've learned today, I feel better prepared for whatever comes our way."

(As they approach the Reichstag Building, they steel themselves for the new historical adventures that lie ahead.)
