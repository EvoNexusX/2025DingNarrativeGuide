Narrator: 

"As the reverberations of the cathedral's past slowly fade, Alex and Katia step back into the hustle and bustle of Berlin's busy streets. Their footprints on this time portal, the Berlin Cathedral, are now part of its history, as they've successfully preserved a piece of its rich heritage. But their journey is far from over. The past is vast, and there are many more stories waiting to be discovered."

Katia:

"Alex, are you ready for our next adventure? We're headed to a place where history isn't confined to a single building but sprawls across an entire island. A place where every step echoes with the voices of the past."

Alex:

"I'm intrigued, Katia. Lead the way!"

Narrator:

"And with that, they set off towards their next destination, their hearts pulsing with anticipation. The cityscape transforms around them, from the grandeur of the cathedral to the collective magnificence of Museum Island. As they approach, the Altes Museum stands like a sentinel of time, heralding their entry into this historical hub."

Katia: 

"Welcome, Alex! Here we are, at Museum Islandâ€” a nexus of time, echoing with the voices of the past. Let's begin our journey into Berlin's rich tapestry of history."

This transition script not only brings a smooth narrative flow from the Berlin Cathedral to Museum Island but also reiterates the theme of time-travel and the importance of history preservation. The transition is justified as the characters continue their quest to explore and protect Berlin's history, moving from an individual monument to a collection of museums, each with its unique story.
