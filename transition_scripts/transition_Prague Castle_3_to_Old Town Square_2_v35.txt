(After spending a while longer at Prague Castle, Katia turns to Alex.)

Katia: (Smiling) "We've had quite the adventure here at the castle, haven't we?"

Alex: (Nods) "Absolutely, it was an experience like no other."

Katia: "I'm glad you enjoyed it, Alex. But Prague is not just about its castle. There's another place that holds the heartbeat of the city."

Alex: (Curious) "Oh? And where might that be?"

Katia: "The Old Town Square. It's a place where you can touch the pulse of Prague's history and feel its life force. It's also known for its various historic events and architectural marvels."

Alex: (Eagerly) "Sounds intriguing! Let's go then."

(They make their way down from the castle and head towards the city center. As they walk, Katia shares tidbits about the city and its history. The transition from the historic castle to the vibrant town square is smooth, as they continue to immerse themselves in the city's rich tapestry of history.)

(Alex and Katia arrive at the Old Town Square.)

Katia: (Gesturing around the square) "Welcome Alex, to the heart of Prague!..."

Note: The transition script effectively moves the narrative from the Prague Castle to the Old Town Square. It maintains the historical and storytelling elements while introducing a new location for the next set of adventures. The smooth transition from one scenic spot to another keeps the audience engaged and curious about what comes next.
