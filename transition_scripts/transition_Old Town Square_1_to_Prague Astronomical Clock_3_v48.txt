Katia: (Gestures to a distance) "Speaking of history, Alex, the Astronomical Clock is our next stop."

Alex: (Turns to look where Katia is pointing) "Oh, I've always wanted to see that. But why the sudden move, Katia?"

Katia: (Smiles mysteriously) "Well Alex, as a historian yourself, you should know that history is a continuous thread, and each event leads to another. The 27 nobles we just discussed? They were executed during the reign of Habsburg, a dynasty known for their love of arts and sciences. That love led to the creation of many architectural wonders, including the Astronomical Clock."

Alex: (Nods in understanding) "Ah, I see the connection now. It's like a living timeline."

Katia: "Exactly, Alex! Let's continue our journey through time, shall we?"

(They leave the Old Town Square, the echoes of the past still resonating as they head towards the Astronomical Clock, ready for their next adventure.)
