(After witnessing the weight of history at the Berlin Cathedral, Alex and Katia step back into the time portal. The portal hums and vibrates, the air ripples around them, and they are whisked away.)

Katia: "That was a heavy experience, Alex. But remember, history isn't always about pain and suffering. It's also about resilience, about standing back up after being knocked down."

Alex: "Speaking of resilience, isn't the Reichstag another symbol of that? It's been the seat of the German Parliament for over a century, right?"

Katia: "Yes, Alex. From its birth during the empire, through the fires of the Nazi era and the Cold War division, to its rebirth after reunification, the Reichstag is a living testament to the resilience of Berlin and its people. It has seen it all."

Alex: "I can't wait to see it firsthand."

Katia: "And you shall, Alex. We're about to step out of the portal."

(The portal opens up to the sight of the magnificent Reichstag building, its glass dome glowing against the Berlin sky.)

Katia: "Welcome to the Reichstag, Alex. Let's delve deeper into its history, and explore the lessons it holds for us."

(They step out of the portal and onto the grounds of the Reichstag, ready to continue their journey through time.)
