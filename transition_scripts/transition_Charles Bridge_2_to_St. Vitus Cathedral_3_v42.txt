(Leaving Charles Bridge behind, Katia and Alex walk through the winding streets of Prague. The hustle and bustle of the city life around them is a stark contrast to the echoes of battle they had just experienced.)

Katia: "I hope that visit to Charles Bridge gave you a taste of Prague's history, Alex. But that's just the beginning. Remember Peter Parler, the architect you learned about on the bridge?"

Alex: "The one who also designed St. Vitus Cathedral?"

Katia: "Exactly. The Cathedral is our next stop, Alex. It's not just another scenic spot, but a cornerstone of Czech history. From the coronations of kings and queens to pivotal events like the Hussite Wars, St. Vitus has been a silent witness to Prague's unfolding narrative."

Alex: "Sounds exciting, Katia. I can't wait to see it."

Katia: "Great! Just like how the Charles Bridge was a testament to Pragueâ€™s rich history, St. Vitus Cathedral serves as a canvas where centuries of history have been painted. Let's continue our journey, stepping further into the pages of time."

(As they approach the towering spires of St. Vitus Cathedral, the city's modern soundscape fades into the background. The stone giant stands before them, ready to whisper its tales to those willing to listen.)
