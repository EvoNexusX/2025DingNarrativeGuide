Katia: "Alex, the Old Town Square has shared its stories, but it's only a part of what Prague has to offer. Shall we visit another historic monument?"

Alex: "Absolutely, Katia. Where are we headed next?"

Katia: "We are going to Charles Bridge, a living testament to Prague's rich history. It connects the Old Town and Lesser Town and was once the only means to cross the river Vltava."

Alex: "Sounds intriguing. Let's go!"

(They leave the Old Town Square, walking through the narrow, winding streets of Prague. The city's history unfolds around them, every corner revealing another aspect of its past. As they approach the bridge, the magnificent Prague Castle looms in the distance.)

Katia: "Here we are, Alex, at the entrance of Charles Bridge. This is where our next adventure begins." 

Alex: "I can't wait to dive into the past again. Let's do this!" 

(Thus, they transition from Old Town Square to Charles Bridge, continuing their journey through time and history.)
